Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a grid for two players to take turns placing X or O. It checks for winning combinations and detects draws when no spaces are left. Players can reset the game at any time.

HTML sets up the game structure, CSS styles the grid and buttons for an appealing look, while JavaScript manages game logic, including player turns, checking results, and updating the display. Save the code in index.html, styles.css, and script.js, then open the HTML file in a browser to play.
